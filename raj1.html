<P>The Indian Navy  is the naval branch of the Indian Armed Forces.
 The <B>President of India</B> serves as Supreme Commander of the Indian Navy.
 The <B>Chief of Naval Staff (CNS)</B>, usually a four-star officer in the rank of <B>Admiral</B>, commands the navy. 
 The Indian Navy is the fifth largest in the world.</P>

<P>The Indian Navy can trace its lineage back to the East India Company's Marine which was founded in 
1612 to protect British merchant shipping in the region. In 1793 the East India Company established its
 rule over eastern part of the Indian subcontinent i.e. Bengal, but it was not until 1830 that the colonial
 navy became known as Her Majesty's Indian Navy. In 1858, East India Company rule gave way to the British Raj
 which lasted until India became independent in 1947. When India became a republic in 1950, the Royal Indian Navy 
as it had been named since 1934 was renamed to Indian Navy. The 17th-century Maratha emperor<B> Chhatrapati Shivaji 
Maharaj</B> is considered as the <B>'Father of the Indian Navy'</B>.</P>

<P> The primary objective of the navy is to secure the nation's maritime borders; India also uses its navy to enhance 
its international relations through joint exercises, port visits and humanitarian missions, including disaster relief. 
In recent years, the Indian Navy has undergone rapid modernisation to replace its ageing equipment currently in service, 
this is often seen as part of "India's drive" to develop blue-water capabilities and enhance its position 
in the Indian Ocean region.</P>
