<P>
The Commander of the Navy is the Chief of Naval Staff (CNS), who holds the rank of Admiral. While the provision
 for the rank of Admiral of the Fleet exists, it is primarily intended for major wartime use and honour. No officer
 of the Indian Navy has yet been conferred this rank. The CNS is assisted in his role as commander of the Navy by the 
Vice Chief of Naval Staff (VCNS), a vice-admiral; the CNS also heads the Integrated Headquarters (IHQ) of the Ministry 
of Defence (Navy), based in New Delhi. The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff (DCNS), a vice-admiral, is the assistant head of 
the IHQ, and is a Principal Staff Officer, along with the Chief of Personnel (COP) and the Chief of Materiel (COM), both 
of whom are also vice-admirals. The Director General Medical Services (Navy) is a Surgeon Vice-Admiral.</P>

<P>The Indian Navy operates three Commands.[84] Each Command is headed by a Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the rank of
 Vice Admiral. The Eastern and Western Commands each have a Fleet commanded by a rear admiral, and each also have a
 Commodore commanding submarines. The Southern Naval Command is home to the Flag Officer Sea Training.</P>

<P>Additionally, the Andaman and Nicobar Command headquartered at Port Blair is a unified tri-services command under the 
Commander in Chief Andaman and Nicobar(CINCAN) who reports to the Chairman Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC) who is
 provided staff support by the Chief ofIntegrated Staff to the Chiefs of Staff Committee (CISC) in New Delhi.
 The Andaman and Nicobar Command, a unified Indian Navy, Indian Army Indian Air Force and Coast Guard Command was
