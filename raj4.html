<P>By the end of the 14th Plan (2019), the Indian Navy expects to have over 150 ships and close to 500 aircraft 
and helicopters. In addition to the existing mission of securing both sea flanks in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian sea,
 the navy would be able to respond to emergency situations far away from the main land. Marine assault capabilities will 
be beefed-up by setting up a new amphibious warfare facility at Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh.</P>

<P>The Indian Navy has initiated Phase II expansion of INS Kadamba, the third largest naval base, near Karwar. 
Phase II will involve expansion of the berthing facilities to accommodate 40 more front-line warships, 
including the aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya, raise manpower to 300 officers and around 2,500 sailors, 
and build a naval air station with a 6,000-foot runway. This is to be followed by Phase IIA and IIB, at the end
 of which INS Kadamba will be able to base 50 front-line warships. The Indian Navy is also in the process of 
constructing a new naval base, INS Varsha, at Rambilli for its Arihant Class submarines.</P>

<P>India plans to construct a pair of aircraft carriers, the first to be built by a South Asian country. 
The first, INS Vikrant, was launched in 2013 by Cochin Shipyard and undocked in June 2015. It is expected to
 be completed by 2017 and undergo extensive sea trials thereafter with commissioning planned for 2018.
 Vikrant displaces 40,000 tonnes and will be capable of operating up to 40 aircraft, including 30 HAL Tejas 
and MiG-29K fighters.[183] The second ship, INS Vishal (formerly known as Indigenous Aircraft Carrier-II), 
will displace around 65,000 tonnes and is expected to be delivered to the Indian Navy by 2025. With the future 
delivery of Vishal, the Navy's goal to have three aircraft carriers in service, with two fully operational carriers 
and the third in refit, will be achieved</P>
