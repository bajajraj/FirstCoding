<P>ccidents in the Indian navy have been attributed to ageing ships in need of maintenance, delayed acquisitions 
by the Ministry of Defence, and human error. However naval commentators also argue that as India's large navy of 160
 ships clocks around 12,000 ship-days at sea every year, in varied waters and weather, some incidents are inevitable.
Captains of erring ships are dismissed from their command following an enquiry. The accident on board INS Sindhuratna
 (S59) led to the resignation of the then Chief of Naval Staff (CNS) Admiral D K Joshi on 26 February 2014, who owned 
moral responsibility.[191] The navy is envisaging a new 'Safety Organisation' to improve safety of its warships, 
nuclear submarines and aircraft in view of its planned increase in fleet strength over the next decade.</P>
